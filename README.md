# A-Study-of-Resiliency-of-Large-Networks-to-Worm-Propagation
The purpose of this program is to study the propagation of worm on the three different types of networks through simulation when no cure (that is, worm defense) is applied. In other words, the worm will continue to spread until no uninfected node remains.
