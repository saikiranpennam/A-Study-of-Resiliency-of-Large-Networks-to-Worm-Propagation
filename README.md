# A-Study-of-Resiliency-of-Large-Networks-to-Worm-Propagation
The purpose of this program is to study the propagation of worm on the three different types of networks through simulation when no cure (that is, worm defense) is applied. In other words, the worm will continue to spread until no uninfected node remains.

In this assignment you will implement two different programs to simulate how a software worm propagates in a computer network (or Online Social Network - OSN) and infects machines. You will experiment with different types of networks, including network of networks, to understand if the topological structure of the network plays any role on how fast the worm propagates and how you can strategize to limit damage from a fast-spreading worm. You will experiment with various curing rates and strategies. A report of the results of your experiments together with your analysis of the same is required for this project. Note that there is no right or wrong answer to this assignment. Hence, your grade would depend on the depth of your analysis, insights and/or innovations.
For this assignment, you will abstract a network (computer or OSN) as an undirected graph 𝐺 = 〈𝑉, 𝐸〉. The set of nodes, 𝑉, in the graph represents the different computers (for computer networks) or users (for OSNs). The set of edges, 𝐸, represents the connection between two machines (for computer networks) or the friendship / trust relationship between two users (for OSNs). An edge 𝑒! = (𝑣" , 𝑣# ), where 𝑒! ∈ 𝐸 and 𝑣" , 𝑣# ∈ 𝑉 exists in the graph if 𝑣" and 𝑣# are directly connected (for computer networks) or are friends (for OSNs). For the rest of this discussion, we will not make a distinction between computer networks and OSNs. We will assume that our graphs do not have parallel edges or self loops.
A network is characterized by its topology. For this project we will first work with three different types of networks: binomial networks (often called Erdös-Rényi network), scale-free networks (often called Barabási-Albert networks), and small- world networks (often called Watts-Strogatz networks). These three networks are specific instances of what are called random networks – some probability density function defines the probability that two nodes in the network are connected to each other by an edge. Do not assume that these are the only types of networks existing in the real world; however, they are fairly representative. Erdös-Rényi networks are the classical networks that aptly describe many real-world phenomenon (such as propagation of virus in a biological population). Barabási-Albert networks fairly
  
accurately describe the topology of the world-wide web. Watts-Strogatz networks model many online social networks. As a first step, perform some research yourself to develop a fair understanding of these networks. WolframAlpha and Wikipedia are good starting points for your research.
A worm spreads autonomously with some probability 𝒑 from an infected node to a non-infected one that is connected to it. In the process, the worm infects the latter node. However, a worm will not spread to a node that is already infected. A worm continues to spread until either (i) it has infected all nodes in the network and has nowhere to spread to, or (ii) it is removed completely by applying a cure to nodes that removes the worm from infected nodes or isolates portions of the network where the worm has not yet spread from other infected portions of the network, and prevents their re-infection or prevents an infection of a node to begin with. What (ii) means is that if a network is “somehow” partitioned into two partitions, the worm cannot jump from one partition where some nodes are infected to the partition where no node is infected. Thus, all nodes in the first partition may be fully infected and then the worm is removed and the infection is cured.
